Counterfactual Regret Minimization, or CFR, is an important algorithm for finding [Nash Equilibria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium) in imperfect information games like poker. When I was learning about it, I had trouble find a clear, easy to understand implementation online, so I wrote one myself.
