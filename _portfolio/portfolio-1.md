In Spring 2021, I got to take part in Robotics Studio, an amazing course offered at Columbia where students design, manufacture, assemble, program, and choreograph dancing robots! I came into the class with no experience with robotics, 3d printing, or CAD, but by the end I had built an awesome robot. Check it out!
