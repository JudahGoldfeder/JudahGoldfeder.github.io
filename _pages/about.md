Welcome! My name is Judah Goldfeder, and I am a Phd student in the [Creative Machines Lab](https://www.creativemachineslab.com/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Hod Lipson](https://www.hodlipson.com/). I am also a student researcher at [Google AI](https://ai.google/).

Research Interests
======
I am interested in most aspects of Artificial Intelligence, but some of the topics that interest me most are Reinforcement Learning, Algorithmic Game Theory, Multi-agent AI, and Unsupervised Representation Learning. While we are quite far away from any form of AGI, I think these topics are all leading in that direction, which is part of why I find them so exciting.
