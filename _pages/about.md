Welcome! My name is Judah Goldfeder, and I am a Phd student in the [Creative Machines Lab](https://www.creativemachineslab.com/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Hod Lipson](https://www.hodlipson.com/), and to be a part of the [AI Institute in Dynamic Systems](https://dynamicsai.org/), generously funded by the [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/). I am also a Student Researcher at [Google AI](https://research.google/people/judahgoldfeder/), and a Research Consultant for [Dicta](https://dicta.org.il/).

Research Interests
======
I am interested in most aspects of Artificial Intelligence, but some of the topics that interest me most are Reinforcement Learning, Algorithmic Game Theory, Multi-agent AI, Unsupervised Representation Learning, Multi-Task Learning and Geometric Learning. While we are quite far away from any form of AGI, I think these topics are all leading in that direction, which is part of why I find them so exciting.

My work has mostly focused on the following areas:
1. Deep Learning and Neural Network Theory
2. Computer Vision
3. Reinforcement Learning
4. AI for Scientific Discovery
5. AI for Sustainability
6. Robotics
7. Network Science

Experience
======
Previously, I was a Machine Learning Intern at [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/), where I worked on applying [Transformers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)) to [Graph Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_neural_network) at scale. I was also a Machine Learning intern at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), where I worked on improving production ads models. Before that, I was a Machine Learning intern at [Google AI](https://ai.google/), where I worked on applying [Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) to improve [HVAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heating,_ventilation,_and_air_conditioning) systems. I also interned at [Learn Ventures](https://learn.ventures/), an innovative education startup, where I worked on [Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) as well as [protein folding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure_prediction). I also was a research intern at [Bar Ilan University](https://www.biu.ac.il/en), where I worked with [Hillel Kugler](https://www.eng.biu.ac.il/hillelk/) on using formal verification to predict gene interaction in cells.
